# API Configuration Migration Complete! 🎉

Your API client has been successfully configured to use environment variables instead of hardcoded URLs. Here's what changed and how to use it:

## What's New

✅ **Environment-based configuration** - API URLs are now managed through environment variables
✅ **Persistent across regenerations** - Your configuration won't be lost when regenerating API code
✅ **Multiple environment support** - Different URLs for development, production, etc.
✅ **Pre-configured client** - Ready-to-use API client with automatic configuration

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up your environment files
```bash
# Copy example files and customize
pnpm run setup:api
```

### 2. Update your API URLs
Edit `.env.development` for local development:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_API_VERSION=1
```

Edit `.env.production` for production:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-api.com
VITE_API_VERSION=1
```

### 3. Use the new API client
```typescript
// Old way (don't use this anymore)
import { ApiClient } from '@/api/ApiClient';
const client = new ApiClient();

// New way (recommended)
import { apiClient } from '@/api/client';
// apiClient is pre-configured with environment variables
```

## File Structure

Your API directory now has these important files:

```
src/api/
├── client.ts          # 🔒 Your custom API exports (safe to edit)
├── config.ts          # 🔒 Environment configuration (safe to edit)
├── index.ts           # ⚠️ Generated (will be overwritten)
├── ApiClient.ts       # ⚠️ Generated (will be overwritten)
└── ...other generated files
```

**🔒 Safe to edit** - These files won't be overwritten during API regeneration
**⚠️ Generated** - These files will be overwritten when you run `pnpm run generate:api`

## Migration Help

If you have existing API imports to update:
```bash
pnpm run migrate:api
```

This will automatically update your imports from the old pattern to the new one.

## Environment Variables

### Required
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Your API base URL
- `VITE_API_VERSION` - API version

### Optional
- `VITE_API_WITH_CREDENTIALS` - Include credentials in requests
- `VITE_API_CREDENTIALS` - Credentials mode (include/omit/same-origin)
- `VITE_API_TOKEN` - API token for authentication
- `VITE_API_USERNAME` - Username for basic auth
- `VITE_API_PASSWORD` - Password for basic auth

## Benefits

🚀 **No more hardcoded URLs** - Easy to switch between environments
🔄 **Regeneration-safe** - Your config survives API regenerations
🛠️ **Developer-friendly** - Simple setup with example files
🔒 **Secure** - Environment files are git-ignored by default

## Need Help?

- Check `docs/API_CONFIGURATION.md` for detailed documentation
- Run `pnpm run setup:api` to initialize environment files
- Run `pnpm run migrate:api` to update existing imports

**Happy coding! Your API is now properly configured for all environments.** 🚀
